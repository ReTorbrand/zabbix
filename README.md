# zabbix

I have decided to release all the changes we've talked with Maxim on Zabbix Summit 2018 based on 4.0 LTS version.
Since the version has came out only a few days ago, and I need some time to merge changes and to do some minimal amount of testing, i am going to release it before October, 15s. 

However you can use develpment 3.4 based version https://github.com/miklert/xe-rabbix. Please note that this version is unstable and must be considered only for using it as a source for your own modifications.
